# capstoneSynasia
The topic I have been researching for my Capstone paper is how to transform sound to vision. I designed a program to transform the images to the sound of different instruments according to the different colour numbers so that people may hear the silent images. 


Steps:
- Uncompressed the audio files into the same file folder with others in folder named 'Synasia'
- Processing should add library Minim
- If you want to try different images with Synasia, control the size of the image smaller than 800*800
